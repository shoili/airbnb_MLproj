# airbnb_MLproj
This project was done by Parit Burintrathikul, Naveed Chowdhury, Shoili Pal and Steven Yeh for their Machine Learning project.

This project uses the Boston Airbnb data available on https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston. The goal is to build a price prediction model.

We use linear regression models and random forests to build the prediction model. Feature generation is done using sentiment analysis on the reviews and building binary features for whether some key words exist in the reviews, description of the properties etc. Feature selection is done using a variety of methods like LASSO and ridge. 

We decided to predict the average price of the listings. Further analysis can be performed to identify trends of how price varies over time.
